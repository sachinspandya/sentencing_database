# Connecticut Sentencing Task Force

## Task Force Recommendation 

>The Commission shall perform the following duties: (1) Facilitate the development and maintenance of a statewide sentencing database in collaboration with existing state and local agencies. . . . .

[Task Force Report (2009, App. A)](https://www.ct.gov/ctsc/lib/ctsc/Final_Report_01-26-09.pdf).

## Task Force Recommendation 

>One of the primary tasks of the Commission will be to develop an extensive sentencing database. The sentencing database will draw on information collected by other state agencies (e.g. Department of Correction, Board of Parole and Pardons, Court Operations Division) . . . 

Task Force Report (2009, p. 10).

## Task Force Recommendation 

>in addition to collecting _new_ offender-specific sentencing information, such as plea information and prior criminal history, which currently is not easily accessible.

Task Force Report (2009, p. 10).

## Task Force Recommendation 

>Once completed, the database will enable the state to follow the offender throughout the entire system, from arrest to post-release supervision, rather than the agency-by-agency approach that is currently in place.

Task Force Report (2009, p. 10).

## Task Force Recommendation

>[T]he data collected will gather information at the individual level rather than
aggregate information . . . . For example, with individual level data, the Commission will be able to determine the number of offenders convicted of burglary in the second degree who are drug-dependent and have previous histories of violence who are incarcerated in state
correctional facilities.

Task Force Report (2009, p. 10).

## Task Force Recommendation 

>The Commission will use its advanced data capacity to inform sentencing policy decisions, gauge the fiscal impact of proposed legislation, help judges determine the appropriate factors to be relied upon in imposing sentences and conduct evaluations of policies and programs.

Task Force Report (2009, p. 10).

## Conn. Gen. Stat. § 54-300

`(f) The commission shall:`

`(1) Facilitate the development and maintenance of a state-wide sentencing database in collaboration with state and local agencies, using existing state databases or resources where appropriate` . . . .

## Conn. Gen. Stat. § 54-300

`(g) Upon completing the development of the state-wide sentencing database pursuant to  `[section f(1)]`, the commission shall review criminal justice legislation as requested and as resources allow.`

## Costs

Ad hoc case-by-case data-sharing agreements with agencies:

1. lost staff time and resources in securing already-collected data
2. can't conduct exploratory data analysis on its own

## Target

Build the Commission sentencing database.

- Data pipelines to already collected by DOCS, CSSD, Court Operations, other agencies
- User interface for targeted and exploratory data analysis by Commission staff.
- Parameterized reporting
